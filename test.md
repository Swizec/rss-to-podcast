# Twilight of the Steam Age, Part 1: Internal Combustion

![](https://technicshistory.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/crossley-otto-gas-engine-1.jpg)

Here in the early decades of the twenty-first century, steam turbines can still be found (though they are almost never seen) but steam piston engines are archaic relics. Nearly every moving machine that we see—cars, trucks, lawnmowers, the aircraft in the sky and the boats in the water—derives its power directly from the combustion of a fuel (such as gasoline) inside of a piston: internal combustion, unlike the external combustion that produces steam from fuel burned outside the boiler.

The internal-combustion engine requires its own chapter in the story of the age of steam, for two reasons. The more obvious is the role the former played in the demise of the latter. The internal-combustion engine could be accused with some fairness of the crime of slaying the steam engine. The other, less obvious, reason is internal combustion developed in reaction to, and under the shadow of, steam. Through the nineteenth century, internal-combustion remained an upstart, seeking a place for itself in a world where steam had become the default choice for anyone in need of mechanical power.[1]

## Early Internal Combustion: A Motive Without Means

The story of the internal combustion engine is an enormously complex one ranging over a century and more; it branches, then converges then branches again as engineers repurposed and remixed design ideas to solve new problems and fill new niches.[2] One could certainly trace it back at least as far as Huygens’ seventeenth-century gunpowder engine; the modern internal combustion engine could be seen as the revenge of the gunpowder engine, much in the same way that the modern water turbine was the revenge of the horizontal water wheel. To tell the complete story in any detail would require another volume at least as large as this one, so I will provide only a montage of the most significant moments and trends as they relate to our larger story.

A thorough history of the internal combustion engine (which I will shorten from now on to “combustion engine” to spare the reader from either an eight-syllable mouthful or the infelicitous initialism “ICE”) would include a laundry list of inventors and inventions, dating back into the eighteenth century or even beyond, almost all of whom have faded into obscurity along with their machines. This is a pattern that should by now be familiar: the steam engine, the steam boat, the locomotive; in every case, a decades-long history can be found of inventors striving after the same vision without quite producing anything that they could convince others of using.
